# AC-MT for Semi-supervised LA Segmentation

This repository will hold the PyTorch implementation of the paper [Ambiguity-selective consistency regularization for mean-teacher semi-supervised medical image segmentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841523001408).

Under construction. 

## Requirements
Some important required packages include:
* Pytorch version >=0.4.1.
* Python == 3.6 
* Cleanlab
* Some basic python packages such as Numpy, Scikit-image, SimpleITK, Scipy, etc. Check requirements.txt.
